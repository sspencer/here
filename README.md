# Here

iOS application and associated web pages that will allow an organization like a Bootcamp (exercise) to take attendance and allow attendees (campers) to view their current status on a web page.

Because Here uses [Parse](http://parse.com/) as a backend, the file with the Parse Client and Application ID are not checked in.  To add your own keys, copy PrivateKeys-sample.h to PrivateKeys.h and add your keys.  PrivateKeys.h is listed in the `.gitignore` file to prevent checkins.
